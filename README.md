## Abstract

We propose a unified formulation for the problem of 3D human pose estimation from a single raw RGB image
that reasons jointly about 2D joint estimation and 3D pose reconstruction to improve both tasks. We take an integrated
approach that fuses probabilistic knowledge of 3D human pose with a multi-stage CNN architecture and uses
the knowledge of plausible 3D landmark locations to refine the search for better 2D locations. The entire process is
trained end-to-end, is extremely efficient and obtains stateof-the-art results on Human3.6M outperforming previous
approaches both on 2D and 3D errors.

## Dependencies

The code is compatible with python2.7
- [Tensorflow 1.0](https://www.tensorflow.org/)
- [OpenCV](http://opencv.org/)

## Models

For this demo, CPM's caffe-models trained on the MPI datasets ([link](https://github.com/shihenw/convolutional-pose-machines-release/tree/master/model)) are used for **2D pose estimation**, whereas for **3D pose estimation** our probabilistic 3D pose model is trained on the [Human3.6M dataset](http://vision.imar.ro/human3.6m/description.php).

## Testing
- First, run `setup.sh` to retreive the trained models and to install the external utilities.
- Run `demo.py` to evaluate the test image.
